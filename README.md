# Santander Login Test

Hi, my name is Eduardo Nunes, and I would like to share my test app with you.

I am coming from Altran Brasil Company.

This sample app was implemented using Kotlin and Clean Architecture.

It has a test coverage about 60%, including unit and instrumented tests.

For testing, I used espresso, robolectric, JUnit and Mockito.

This app was developped using Android Studio 3.4.1

To run, just open this project on your Android Studio and press the Play button.

If you would like to check the test coverage, just run *jacocoTestReport* task from gradle, but please, remember that you need to have a device plugged on your PC or a emulator running.

If you have any question, do not hesitate to contact me.
